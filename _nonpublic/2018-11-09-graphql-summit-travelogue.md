### Departing flight

Plane 1 (Halifax - Toronto): 737 MAX 8

Seat ? (window above wing)

Took off in fog, enjoyed dramatic view above the cloud layer, watched Ready Player One. The gaps in the clouds were fascinating on our descent.

Plane 2 (Toronto - San Francisco): 787

Seat 37B -> 37A

Forgot to empty one of my pockets when going through the scanner. Met Josh at security.

Nobody showed up for seat 37A so I was able to move over.

Napped, listened to Samuele and Stromae, watched Tomb Raider and The Good Place. Arrived slightly early (8:30pm), in the dark.

Beautiful view of Salt Lake City and then of the coastline in the dark. 

Met Josh, collected his bag, got USD from an atm (thanks helpful person at the currency conversion kiosk), and took a taxi to the hotel. Contemplated getting delivery or going down to the hotel bar but just went to sleep instead.

### Day 1

Woke up shortly before 7am and got a message from Josh making breakfast plans. Also saw orca chatter. Copied events for orca and provided guidance on running the scripts. Went down for breakfast at 7:35am.

Buffet breakfast included scrambled eggs, hash browns with peppers and onions, bacon, chicken apple sausage, tomato, and an apricot jam pastry. The hotel coffee was okay.

The wind was cold on our walk to the conference but the sun was out (15C). Check in went quickly.

### Day 1 conference

Keynote 1

Lunch - bento box with salmon, salmon rolls, noodles, crunchy beans, and a seaweed/mushroom thing. Walked with Josh down to Twitter and Uber HQ. Saw the civic centre and public library, city hall, school board building, Jaguar/British Motors building, auto history museum (?).

Graphql in production

Teaching graphql

### Day 1 evening

Went to Grass Roots dispensary.

Dinner at Aicha - lamb tagine with green peas, mint tea.

Took ubers to and from Chubbies to buy swim trunks. Asked cashier if they had manta ray shorts in med but was disappointed. Ended up with palm trees. Got to experience the SF hills.

Went down to the bar for drinks with Josh. He brought his laptop and we talked functional programming, Rust. Had a steam beer, ipa (?) and a Talisker 10 ($15 for maybe 3oz).

Went around the corner to Grubstake for food (chicken sandwich with onions) and a Dogfish 90 Minute IPA.

Took a look at the fitness centre before going back to the room, but didn't go in. Drank a lot of water before bed.

### Day 2 morning

Got up, checked orca channel, made breakfast plans with Josh for 8:45am, walked out to the pool but didn't swim.

Ate the same breakfast but with pork sausage. Drank a lot of coffee.

### Day 2 conference

Had a good swim at lunch in the 6th floor pool. There was one person lounging but I had the pool to myself.

I was late getting lunch (didn't realize the hotel didn't serve lunch) and I ended up getting a great chicken sandwich and Lagunitas IPA from 11-0-1 but missed the 2:30pm talk.  

### Day 2 evening

Went back to hotel after conference. Puttered around cleaning up until supper at 6:30pm. Went to La Fina Estampa for Peruvian supper -- I had pasta with clams, shrimp and mussels in a slightly spicy sauce; Josh had chicken and potatoes with a garlic sauce, and we had Peruvian beer. 

Went back to the hotel with a short detour to check out an electronics store -- disappointing. Said goodbye to Josh and headed back to the room.

### Returning fight

Plane 1 (San Francisco - Montreal): 737 MAX 8

Seat 26E -> 26F

Got up at 5:30 and checked out around 6:10. Took an uber to the airport. San Francisco was covered in haze from wildfires.

There was a good helpful security person telling people where to put their laptop/phones/belt/shoes ("that'll get you a patdown").

Took a quick look through duty free but was feeling overwhelmed and short on time.

The flight was full and I opted to check my bag. I got a tasty raspberry almond scone and vegan chocolate cookie from Napa Market (?) in the airport. 

A French couple had booked the seats on either side of me so they let me take the window seat. 

Slept for the first 2h and watched "Io c'e" and a short film "Saman" (?).

In Montreal, cleared customs without issue and (... ?)

Plane 2 (Montreal - Halifax): A320-200

Seat 14F

Had the row to myself. Same flight crew as the previous flight. Took off in the rain.
