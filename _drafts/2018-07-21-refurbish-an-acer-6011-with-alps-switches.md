title: Refurbishing an Acer 6011 (Alps SKCM White switches)
---

### Necessary equipment:

- screwdrivers
  - philips (for opening keyboard)
  - tiny flat head (for opening switches)
  - large flat head (for levering keycaps off)
- old toothbrush
- denture tabs
- canned air
- dry silicone/teflon lube
- isopropyl rubbing alcohol
- containers for parts (mason jars and lids)
- paper towel
- rubber gloves

### Nice to have:

- q-tips
- cheap paintbrush
- mr clean magic eraser
- tweezers
- needle-nose pliers

### Preamble:

I bought a used Acer 6011 on ebay for about $30 plus shipping and thought I got a deal. The keyboard was obviously used and dirty, but I have bought IBM keyboards that were filthy, but still worked fine mechanically, and cleaned up nicely. I didn't realize how easily Alps switches are contaminated with dirt by comparison.

This board was obviously heavily used by multiple people. In addition to caked on dirt, crumbs, and lots of hair, it included several (dead) spiders. One of the spacebar stabilizers was missing, but I found it stuck inside another keycap in a little silk cocoon.


### Recommendation:

Don't do this. Buy a new/new-old-stock board with clean Alps or clone switches, unless you have a lot more time and patience than money.


### General advice:

Start by plugging the board in as-is and checking if all the keys work. In my case, some keys were unresponsive: 7, E, G and H.

When opening a dirty keyboard, do it outside. Use a cloth/tarp so you don't lose any bits. Give it an initial blast of compressed air and brush surface gunk out.

Never leave loose key parts sitting out (caps, housing, sliders, springs). Always put them in a box/jar/tray. I like jam jars because I can put big pieces in the jar and small springs, screws etc in the lid.


### Cleaning keycaps:

Use a flat head screwdriver to help lever the keycaps off. Always pry Alps from the side to avoid breaking the stems off in the switch. Note the numpad + and Enter have the switches turned sideways (so go from the top/bottom). I think some Apple boards have the f-keys sideways too.

The stabilizers can be popped out of their clips using the screwdriver tip too. I usually leave the stabilizers attached to the caps whenever I can, to avoid losing parts.

Once all the keycaps are off, put them in a large jar with 3 denture tabs and fill with hot (not boiling) water. Wait about 10-20 minutes then drain, rinse with water, and spread out on a piece of paper towel to try. Leave to dry overnight.

If there are stubborn markings on the sides of the caps, try scrubbing with a magic eraser.


### Disassembling and cleaning Alps switches:

Use a small (electronics) flat head screwdriver to pry open the top tab holding the top housing in. Grip the top of the slider with your fingertips (the slider has ridges). Pry open the bottom tab and pull the top assembly out.

Make sure you collect the housing, slider, click leaf and spring. Ideally, put them in separate trays.

Use compressed air to clean out the bottom housing of all the switches. Then use your brushes to get any remaining dirt, being careful not to flatten or yank the contact leaves which remain in the switches. 

Controversial suggestion: put the top housings and sliders in jars and add denture tabs and hot water. Other people will say it's better to brush these out and use only rubbing alcohol if needed, but I got decent results cleaning them this way all at once and then re-applying a spray lube.

Leave the housings and sliders to dry overnight.

Inspect a few of the housings for remaining dirt. If they were really filthy, you may need to brush them out or clean with a q-tip.

Line a cardboard box (or similar) with some paper towel. Place the sliders on the paper towel.

Put on rubber gloves.

Spray the aerosol lube over the sliders, wait a minute for the spray to dry, then flip the sliders and spray the other side. Don't worry too much about coverage. 

Put the springs and click leaves in a strainer or cheesecloth pouch and gently spray them with compressed air to remove any loose dust. 


### Reassembling Alps switches:

Instead of (other guy)'s method, do:

- Put the slider in the top housing (make sure the slider divot faces away from the alps logo)
- Put the click leaf in the top housing (click leaf goes on the side that has the alps logo)
- Position the spring in the bottom housing over the bottom nub, leaning away from the contact leaf
- Use the top half of the key to 'scoop' the spring towards the contact leaf.
- If the spring stays correctly seated, the slider should pop up with a 'clink' as you push down.


Most common problems:

- No click:

  The click leaf is stuck in the housing. Remove, re-seat the click leaf and try again. 

- Key action is too heavy or gritty:

  The spring is out of place. Remove and reassemble.

- Key still feels wrong, even after reassembling:

  Double check that the top housing and the slider are in the right orientation (alps logo away from contact leaf, slider divot away from alps logo). I made this mistake 3 or 4 times when reassembling the switches on the 6011.
