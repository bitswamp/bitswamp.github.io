The gardening was a mixed bag this year. We got cherry tomatoes and lettuce which are nice and reliable, but I meant to grow 3 kinds of pepper and I ended up with a final harvest of 4 mini bell peppers. My cayenne peppers never sprouted and my jalapenos got sad and withered.

We grew dill and never used it, arugula that went right to seed, strawberries that we got to snack on once or twice, and nasturtiums that took over their planter. I ate some nasturtium flowers but Laura wasn’t very interested.

So, I guess I overextended a bit, but for the most part I kept things alive and didn’t let anything drown or cook in the sun. Next year I’ll get started earlier, fertilize more heavily, and will try for repeats rather than adding a bunch of new plants.

One fully successful thing I did in the spring was build new planters — I learned how to make more-or-less square corners and how to use a few different hand tools that were new to me. Now I’ve got chisels and rasps and all kinds of gadgets.
